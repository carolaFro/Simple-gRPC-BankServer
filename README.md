# Simple-gRPC-BankServer
This project implements a distributed banking system using gRPC in Python, where customers interact with multiple bank branches that collectively maintain a single shared account balance. The system ensures real-time balance consistency and synchronization across all branches while supporting concurrent deposit, withdrawal, and query operations.
